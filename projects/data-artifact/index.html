We analyze the ELECTRA-small model’s errors under adversarial examples, offering specific instances and behavioral examples. We explore three mitigation methods: (1) Data Cartography for dynamic analysis and subset selection, (2) dataset augmentation with adversarial examples and evaluation using unseen adversarial test data, and (3) fine-tuning on SQuAD 2.0 to gauge generalization and robustness. Method (1) highlights faithful representation in subsets like “easy” and “ambiguous.” Method (3) uncovers persistent data artifacts, while Method (2) yields improved exact-match/F1 scores, raising questions about genuine comprehension enhancement versus dataset artifacts.

These artifacts can lead to the models performing well on benchmark datasets but poorly on real-world tasks. The existence of dataset artifacts could be investigated by various methods, such as “contrast examples” <d-cite key="gardner-etal-2020-evaluating"></d-cite>, adversarial examples <d-cite key="jia-liang-2017-adversarial"></d-cite> and checklist examples <d-cite key="ribeiro-etal-2020-beyond"></d-cite>.</p> <p>In this report, we adapted the methods formulated in <d-cite key="jia-liang-2017-adversarial"></d-cite>, using adversarial examples to study the existence of dataset artifacts in the Stanford Question Answering Dataset <d-cite key="rajpurkar-etal-2016-squad"></d-cite> (SQuAD version 1.1) on the ELECTRA-small model <d-cite key="clark2020electra"></d-cite>.</p> <p>The rest of the report is structured as follows. In section 2, we introduce the pre-trained model, ELECTRA-small <d-cite key="clark2020electra"></d-cite>, in our benchmark, and detailed the adversarial examples we used to attack the original model. We showed some classes of mistakes the model makes, and give examples of specific errors and behavior from the model. In section 3, we attempt to mitigate these dataset artifacts using three methods: (1) Using Data Cartography <d-cite key="swayamdipta-etal-2020-dataset"></d-cite> to map out the training dynamics and select a subset of the original dataset to retrain. (2) We argument the original dataset with adversarial examples and evaluate the performance of the re-trained model with another adversarial test dataset that the model never seen. (3) We fine-tune the ELECTRA-small model on the larger SQuAD version 2.0 dataset and evaluate the ability of generalization and robustness against adversial examples.</p> <h2 id="part-1-analysis">Part 1 Analysis</h2> <h3 id="model">Model</h3> <p>The ELECTRA <d-cite key="clark2020electra"></d-cite> model has the same architecture as the BERT <d-cite key="devlin2018bert"></d-cite> model, but it has an improved training method. Unlike traditional models such as BERT, which use masked language modeling (MLM), ELECTRA introduces a unique “replaced token detection” method. This involves training a text encoder to distinguish authentic input tokens from high-quality negative samples produced by a smaller generator network. ELECTRA’s training jointly trains the generator and discriminator, a method that proved more effective than alternative training algorithms like the two-stage procedure. Notably, ELECTRA demonstrates superior performance over traditional MLM-based methods with the same computational resources. For instance, ELECTRA-400K outperforms similar compute-based models like RoBERTa-100K and BERT baselines, and ELECTRA-1.75M scores higher on benchmarks like SQuAD 2.0, all while utilizing less computational power. In this report, we perform the analysis using the ELECTRA-small which has 14M parameters.</p> <h3 id="dataset">Dataset</h3> <p>The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) <d-cite key="rajpurkar-etal-2016-squad"></d-cite> is a benchmark dataset widely used in the field of Natural Language Processing for training and evaluating machine learning models on the task of question answering. Developed by Stanford University researchers, SQuAD contains over 100,000 questions derived from Wikipedia articles. The dataset is divided into two versions: SQuAD1.1 and SQuAD2.0.</p> <p>SQuAD1.1, the first version, features questions for which the answers are segments of text (spans) found within the corresponding Wikipedia article, focusing on reading comprehension. In contrast, SQuAD2.0 extends this by including over 50,000 unanswerable questions, designed to resemble answerable ones. This addition challenges models to not only find answers but also discern when no answer is available within the given text. These datasets have become standard benchmarks in the AI community, pushing forward advancements in deep learning models for text understanding and comprehension.</p> <h3 id="adversarial-attacks">Adversarial Attacks</h3> <p>One way to test whether the model could accurately answer questions about paragraphs is evaluation on examples containing adversarially inserted sentences. These sentences were designed to distract computer systems without changing the correct answer or misleading human readers. Following the adversarial evaluation method in <d-cite key="jia-liang-2017-adversarial"></d-cite>, we analyze the performance of the pre-trained ELECTRA-small model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) with two different types of adversarial examples, *AddSent} and *AddOneSent}.</p> <h4 id="addsent-method"> <em>AddSent</em> Method</h4> <p>The <em>AddSent</em> method involves a multi-step procedure to generate adversarial examples for testing reading comprehension systems. Initially, the method applies semantics-altering perturbations to the original question to ensure compatibility, which includes changing nouns, adjectives, named entities, and numbers, often using antonyms from WordNet or nearest words in GloVe word vector space. Following this, a fake answer is created, which aligns with the same “type” as the original answer. This classification is based on a set of predefined types determined according to Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. Subsequently, the altered question and the fake answer are combined into a declarative sentence. This combination is achieved through the application of manually defined rules that operate over CoreNLP constituency parses. The final step in the process involves crowdsourcing to rectify any grammatical or unnatural errors in the generated sentences. This comprehensive procedure ensures the creation of adversarial examples that are both challenging for reading comprehension systems and yet remain coherent and plausible to human readers.</p> <p><strong><em>AddSent</em> Example:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Original Question: “What city did Tesla move to in 1880?”</li> <li>Altered Question: “What city did Tadakatsu move to in 1881?”</li> <li>Generated Adversarial Sentence: “Tadakatsu moved to the city of Chicago in 1881.”</li> </ul> <h4 id="addonesent-method"> <em>AddOneSent</em> Method</h4> <p>The <em>AddOneSent</em> method adopts a simpler approach compared to <em>AddSent</em> for generating adversarial examples, focusing on the addition of a random sentence to the paragraph. This method operates independently of the model, requiring no access to the model or its training data. The core idea behind <em>AddOneSent</em> is the addition of a human-approved sentence that is grammatically correct and does not contradict the correct answer but is otherwise unrelated to the context of the question. This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that existing reading comprehension models are overly stable and can be easily confused by the introduction of unrelated information. By simply appending a random sentence, <em>AddOneSent</em> tests the model’s ability to discern relevant information from distractions, challenging the model’s comprehension capabilities. This method highlights the potential weaknesses in the model’s contextual understanding and its vulnerability to irrelevant data, providing insights into areas where the model’s robustness can be improved.</p> <h3 id="error-analysis">Error Analysis</h3> <p>We analyze the performance of the pre-trained ELECTRA-small model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) with two different types of adversarial examples, <em>AddSent</em> and <em>AddOneSent</em>. The Code is developed based on the Course starting code, and make use of the Huggingface Transformer and Dataset module. The <em>AddSent</em> and <em>AddOneSent</em> are retrieved from the Huggingface Dataset Hub.<d-footnote>[https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad_adversarial](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad_adversarial)</d-footnote></p> <h4 id="result">Result</h4> <p>The baseline model, ELECTRA-small model, trained on the full SQuAD ver 1.1 train dataset achieves a exact match score of $78.17$ and F1-score of $85.94$ on the validation dataset.

A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, it tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources.

This process allows us to navigate the dataset’s landscape effectively and pinpoint areas that may be prone to artifacts or inconsistencies. Armed with this insight, we can judiciously select a subset of the original dataset for retraining, minimizing the impact of problematic data points.</li> <li>Our second approach involves augmenting the original dataset with adversarial examples. These artificially generated data points introduce variations and edge cases, challenging the model to adapt and improve its performance. Crucially, we then evaluate the model using a fresh adversarial test dataset that it has never encountered during training. This robust evaluation provides insights into the model’s ability to generalize and handle unforeseen adversarial scenarios.</li> <li>In our third method, we undertake fine-tuning of the ELECTRA-small model on a larger dataset, specifically the SQuAD version 2.0 dataset. This process exposes the model to a more extensive and diverse set of examples, fostering improved generalization and adaptability. We subsequently evaluate the model’s performance under the influence of adversarial examples, assessing its resilience in the face of potential attacks.</li> </ol> <h3 id="method-1-data-cartography">Method 1 Data Cartography</h3> <p>The paper “Dataset Cartography: Mapping and Diagnosing Datasets with Training Dynamics” \cite{swayamdipta-etal-2020-dataset} utilizes training dynamics, which involves analyzing the model’s behavior on individual instances during training. The key innovation lies in deriving two measures for each data instance: the model’s confidence in the true class and the variability of this confidence across training epochs. The research reveals three distinctive areas in the data maps. First, it identifies ambiguous regions where the model’s predictions are not clear, significantly affecting out-of-distribution generalization. Second, it highlights easy-to-learn regions, which are numerous and crucial for model optimization. Lastly, it uncovers hard-to-learn regions, often corresponding to labeling errors. These insights suggest that prioritizing data quality over quantity can lead to more robust models and enhanced performance in scenarios where the data distribution is different from the training distribution.</p> <p>In our experiment, we first trained the ELECTRA-small model on the full SQuAD v1.1 dataset and logged the training dynamics to get the data map shown in <a href="#fig:data-cart">Figure.5 </a>. Next, we re-trained the model on different subsets of the SQuAD dataset as defined in <a href="#tab:data-cart">Table2</a>. Our results show that none of data subset has better accuracies than the fullset. However, the “Hard” set does perform much worse than the others, and ignoring them does not significantly degrade the accuracy. This is likely because the “hard-to-learn” examples are those where the context and the questions are ambiguous, and the answers may be wrong.</p> <p><a id="fig:data-cart"></a> <img src="/assets/img/dataset-artifact.png" alt="Alt text" width="700"></p> <p><strong>Data-Map of the SQuAD v1.1 full train-set on ElECTRA-small model.</strong></p> <p><a name="tab:data-cart"></a></p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Eval Dataset</th> <th>Data Subset</th> <th> <em>AddOneSent</em> <strong>Exact Match</strong>/<strong>F1</strong> </th> <th> <em>AddSent</em> <strong>Exact Match</strong>/<strong>F1</strong> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Baseline (SQuAD v1.1)</td> <td>All</td> <td>$62.28/69.34$</td> <td>$53.14/59.96$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Easy</td> <td>confidence $&gt; 0.5$</td> <td>$57.86/65.22$</td> <td>48.37/55.38</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hard</td> <td>confidence $&lt; 0.5$</td> <td>$48.85/61.92$</td> <td>37.67/45.90</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Easy and Ambiguous (I)</td> <td>confidence $&gt; 0.6$ and variability $&gt;0.3$</td> <td>$59.71/65.76$</td> <td>$49.44/55.24$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Easy and Ambiguous (II)</td> <td>confidence $&gt; 0.7$ and variability $&gt;0.35$</td> <td>$56.69/63.30$</td> <td>$45.76/51.97$</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Table 2</strong> We trained the ELECTRA-small model on different subsets of the full SQuAD dataset, where the subsets are different regions of the <em>confidence/variability</em> Data Map</p> <h3 id="method-2-training-the-adversarial-examples">Method 2 Training the Adversarial Examples</h3> <p>Aiming at learning the errors caused by the adversarial examples, we trained the ELECTRA-small Model on the full SQuAD v1.1 Dataset and the <em>AddOne</em> adversarial examples.

This signals that learning with some adversarial examples helps improving the robustness against dataset artifacts. However, we did not implement the \textit{AddSentMod} adversarial examples in the original paper, where they showed that putting the inserted sentences elsewhere instead of in the last line will significantly decrease the EM/F1 scores. This may be that the model learns to ignore the last sentence instead of the semantics.</p> <h3 id="method-3-fine-tuning-on-squad-v20">Method 3 fine-tuning on SQuAD v2.0</h3> <p>The baseline model is trained on the SQuAD v1.1 version, which we saw in the previous section suffers significantly from adversarial attacks. Therefore, we experiment re-training the ELECTRA-small model on a similar and larger datatset, SQuAD v2.0. The newer version extends the version 1.1 by including over 50,000 unanswerable questions, designed to resemble an- swerable ones. This addition challenges models to not only find answers but also discern when no answer is available within the given text. Our experiment shows a Exact-Match/F1 score of <strong>58.25/65.48</strong> against the <em>AddOne</em> adversarial examples and <strong>49.07/55.55</strong> against the <em>AddSent</em> adversarial examples.</p> <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2> <p>Throughout this study, we adapted the adversarial example approach established by Jia and Liang (2017) to assess the presence of dataset artifacts within the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD version 1.1) using the ELECTRA-small model as their testing ground. We investigated the errors of the ELECTRA-small model on the SQuAD dataset under adversarial examples. Specific model errors and behavior examples are also provided.</p> <p>The experimentation section of this report details three distinct methods employed to mitigate the impact of dataset artifacts: (1) The application of Data Cartography to analyze training dynamics and select a subset of the original dataset for retraining. (2) The augmentation of the original dataset with adversarial examples, followed by the evaluation of the retrained model’s performance using an unseen adversarial test dataset. (3) The fine-tuning of the ELECTRA-small model on the larger SQuAD version 2.0 dataset to assess its generalization and robustness against adversarial examples.</p> <p>While it became evident that Method (1) and Method (3) did not yield improved scores under adversarial examples, Method (1) did shed light on the fact that certain subsets of the SQuAD dataset, particularly the “easy” and “ambiguous” subsets, faithfully represent the original data distribution. Method (3) exposed the persistence of data artifacts within the ELECTRA model, even after training on the larger SQuAD v2.0 dataset.</p> <p>Method (2) demonstrated that training the model with adversarial examples led to a significant enhancement in the exact-match/F1 score when tested against another set of adversarial test data. Nevertheless, the report concludes by acknowledging the lingering uncertainty about whether these improved benchmark results genuinely reflect an enhancement in the model’s sentence comprehension abilities or merely represent another set of dataset artifacts and anomalous correlations .</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/2024-07-dataset-artifact.bib"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 PoJen Wang.
